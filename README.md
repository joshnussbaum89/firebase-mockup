# From Code To Mockup

# Techdegree F.E.W.D. Slack Challenge Project 02

**These projects are not required to complete your Treehouse Techdegree. They are a supplement to your learning and can be great additions to your portfolio as full projects.**

## **Description** - 
`You're working for a company as a front-end developer. Your boss tells you that your team is putting the finishing touches on a plugin they've been developing; fireboxjs. The design team has created a mockup for the landing page for this plugin and your boss needs you to code it out with just HTML and CSS!`

## **Getting Started**
When downloading this project, you'll recieve a folder called `firebsejs`. Inside this folder you'll find a few more folders. (firebasejs_master, mockups, images, css, and an `index.html` file) - Open up the mockups folder and you'll see the mockup the design team has created for you. The goal is for you to write all the HTML and CSS to execute the mockup as closely as you can. All the images and icons you will need are included in the images folder. Should you get stuck, feel free to reach out and ask for some assistance. 
- Please note that firebasejs-master is the completed project all coded out. You should only use that as a reference if you feel you truly need it.
